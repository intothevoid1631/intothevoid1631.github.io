<p class="has-drop-cap">It's been another super busy week, but one of those weeks where I try to just work through it and look forward to warmer weather. I've been getting some time for myself a little bit here and there, I even got a few bike rides in. Emma is sleeping okay, but is still waking up some nights. I have my sleep apnea appointment set to get setup with a cpap machine, so that might make things better once I get used to sleeping hooked up to some machine.</p>
<p>We had a pretty good weekend. Went to my parents on Saturday for Easter, but I had a huge headache for most of it, so I wasn't too present mentally. Sunday was better. I got another headache, but we spent most of the day at Jeff &amp; Whitney's, relaxing, eating food, and playing D&amp;D together. K is always surprised when I play because I step outside of my comfort zone quite a bit more than usual.</p>
<p>I had one of those moments of clarity this week, I came back from shopping or something and I was just in a bad mood. I don't recall why, its just one of those days where everything seems to upset you (kind of like you notice that your belt loop only gets caught on a door handle when you're in a bad mood). Things weren't going well, the kids were misbehaving, I hit my head on the patio umbrella trying to get it fixed for K, just a crap afternoon. But an hour later everything was fine and I just had that moment of realization that all things do eventually pass, anger fades and things get better. I was able to just take a long breath and be in the moment for a few after I was feeling better and I really needed that.</p>
<p>I'm sitting in a meeting right now listening to a company update and they're talking about our financial forecast and it doesn't sound the best. I'm pretty sure things will be fine, but man I'd just like to catch a break where things settle down and everything is okay. For a week maybe? That'd be nice. I think my stress levels are higher than I let on to, my eye is still twitching on and off, and its been doing this since Christmas. I can't imagine what it'd be like if I drank coffee...</p>
<p>K's hearing is better, not super noticeably, but she's definitely saying 'what?' a lot less. A win is a win. Her attitude has been better this week too, I'm not sure if that's helping or not, but I can't imagine it doesn't make day to day life at least a little better.</p>
