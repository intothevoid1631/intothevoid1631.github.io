<p>Spending the morning taking care of E and K who are both really sick. Setting up this blog and GitHub deploy access while A relaxes in the toy room. Not much else going on of note.</p>
<p>I hope I can stick with journaling here and get more in touch with everything that I am feeling, becoming more aware and in the moment.</p>
