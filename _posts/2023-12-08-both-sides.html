<h2>Emotional Calculus</h2>
<p>Soemthing I've talked about a little bit but wanted to expand upon is what I'm calling my <i>Emotional Calculus</i>. My inability to take 'me' time has a huge impact on my overall mental health and I am realizing this more and more, however when I do take time, say on Friday's, I don't actually enjoy it. I've been thinking about why and I started with my calculus theory. Any action I think about taking I immediately ask myself 'how is this going to impact Kendall or the girls vs how much enjoyment am I going to get out of it'. If I want to go out for an evening, whats the cost? Is Kendall going to be burnt out and upset when I get home? Not necessarily mad at me for going out, but when she gets negative, I <i>really</i> don't like it. Is the discomfort of her being grumpy worth the enjoyment of taking time for myself? She wants me to go out, but when I do and come home she's irritable and tired, which almost wipes out any positives I get from being out. Is a two hour bike ride worth an afternoon of her irritation? Is going out to dinner by myself worth the lecture I get for not spending time with the kids? </p>
<p>Thats another thing...I feel like I'm in a lose-lose situation. I get grief for not taking me time, but if I take me time, I get grief for not spending one on one time with the girls. If I take Emma out, Kendall asks why I don't spend time with Emma. If I take Emma out, why am I not out with Alison! If I take both of them out, why am I not taking me time? Its frustrating.</p>
<h2>Both Sides</h2>
<p>The other thing I've been chewing on is that I both sides almost EVERY opinion/thought I have. At work today I started thinking about an initiative about what the Marketing Department was doing, so I started dumping my thoughts on why I think it wasn't the best idea. I jotted down a few paragraphs and sent them to my manager (who is very receptive to diverse opinions), but then I spent the next 10 minutes thinking about why Marketing SHOULD be doing what they're doing. I essentially argued against my own point and just about negated it.</p>
<p>A more straight forward example would be (in my head) I would argue for 5 minutes about how much Chocolate Ice Cream is the best and how much I love it, then automatically start thinking the exact opposite - why people would think Vanilla is the best and what their perspective might be. The outcome would be an almost completely neutral approach where I give both sides merit and just toss my opinion out the window and not speak up.</p>
<p>I think this happens A LOT and I don't even notice. I keep quiet so I don't rock the boat. I saw a post online somewhere but can't find it now about how some children think the best way to be loved is to not cause any issues and keep in the background. We've talked about this a lot and I know 100% that I'm like that, but I never really thought about how it's impacting my current behavior. I never thought of it as an inhibitor, I just thought it meant I just keep my head down. What I'm realizing is that it makes me not advocate for myself in day to day situations. I'll standup for myself in important life stuff, I'm not a doormat, but on regular things I definitely keep quiet. The most shining example that ALWAYS comes up is restaurants - when a group of people are getting together I very rarely say NO, I don't want to eat there. I just go with the group decision, even if its something I really don't like.</p>
