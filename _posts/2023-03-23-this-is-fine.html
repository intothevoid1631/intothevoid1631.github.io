<p>Wake up. Get the kids off to school. Work. Dishes. Dinner. Dishes. Get the kids to bed. Pass out. Repeat. I feel completely stuck in a cycle and I don't know how to get out of it. It's not like I can just not send the kids to school. I only have a limited amount of PTO, and if I don't work we don't have a house. If I don't take care of the house we live in filth. On top of everything else it's been a month straight of <i>someone</i> in the house being sick. Whether its one of the girls or my wife they have just been passing around stomach bugs, strep throat, or random viruses. There hasn't been a day when one of em isn't running a fever, throwing up, hacking and coughing, or just plain miserable.</p>
<p>I try to look ahead and focus on summer, when things finally settle down a bit and we have more flexibility. Don't have to worry about school, and a lot of times everyone is out of the house so at least its quiet when I'm stuck working. I'd like to get some long bike rides in but at this point it seems so far off. I've been trying to look at the positives - our budget seems to be holding strong the past few months, we haven't dipped into savings at all. I'm sticking to my New Years Resolutions surprisingly, and it's already almost April, that's probably about 2.5 months longer than I've ever held onto them before.</p>
<h2>How can something so small ruin someones day?</h2>
<p>The other thing that keeps coming around is peoples bad moods. I'm pretty even keeled and if I'm in a bad mood I try to not take it out on other people, but when K is in a bad mood it's coming out no matter whose around. Today our neighbor was out measuring something around his garage window. This ruined her day. She's fed up and anytime she even sees certain neighbors she gets grumpy. Then she turns it on me like I'm the one doing things annoying her. We've talked about it before but it just is something she has a hard time with. She's so irritated by them if she had her way we'd have moved a few weeks after buying the house. I keep telling her its a hell of a gamble to move somewhere else because you don't like the neighbors, unless you get someplace out in Montana where you have acres between houses. But then she'd get upset that we don't have amenities nearby. Sometimes our living situation feels like a lose lose. I know its not my job to make her happy, I just wish <i>something</i> would.</p>
