<p class="has-drop-cap">It's not super often that a day goes from okay to complete shit in one sentence. We were laying in bed and K was watching Handmaids Tale. She suddenly asks me what our plans are if martial law is declared and the world starts to end. I try to tell her I don't have a plan. This upsets her. Clearly I don't care enough about the family to plan for this doomsday scenario. Then she gets upset that I can't come up with a plan on the spot (another example of "I don't know" and then "well, okay, but..."). When I try to explain to her that the odds of that happening are very low, suddenly I am gaslighting her and invalidating her concerns. It's at this point I realize I am in a Lose Lose Lose Lose situation.</p>

<h2>Any way I lose</h2>
<h3>I lose #1</h3>
<p>She's upset that I haven't planned for the Handmaids Tale scenario. I don't care enough for our family to clearly plot out what happens when a dictator comes to power and relegates all women to either be brood mares for the state or subserviant wives. Apparently I was supposed to already have a go-bag packed so we can flee to Canada the day after the election.</p>
<h3>I lose #2</h3>
<p>She's upset that I won't lay in bed plotting how to flee the country. Who cares that my entire weekend was spent taking care of the girls while she got a relaxing evening at the hotel with Lindsay, and then was too tired to do anything Sunday night. I don't want to lay in bed right before falling asleep planning for the end of civilization, I don't want to spend the next 6 months terrified of something that <i>might</i> happen.</p>
<h3>I lose #3</h3>
<p>She's upset that I am dismissing her concerns and gaslighting her that the world isn't coming to an end. If I say anything to console her, or downplay the possibilty of Trump winning the election I am being dismissive. I'm not listening to her.</p>
<h3>I lose #4</h3>
<p>She's upset that I disengage and leave her to watch her show. I've been in that situation many times before, and they say the devil you know beats the devil you don't every time. Well, I'd rather her be upset that I left then have her be upset that I'm dismissing her concerns and gaslighting her. I get up, quietly leave the room, and sleep downstairs.</p>
<p>So here we are, Tuesday morning, Im running on about 2 or 3 hours sleep, I haven't had a break in probably a month, and she's being passive aggresive about everything. I don't know why I am the bad guy here, and why I should have to apologize for her getting upset at something that I believe is irrational. Can I get upset about things I'm scared of then get mad at her for not doing enough about them and make her apologize? Nope.</p>
<p>I honestly don't have a solution and now I have to work 8 hours, then go downstairs to clean up and make dinner, then odds are put both girls down because she's too tired, then pass out and do it all again. I have no idea.</p>
